This is a placeholder for the screenshot.

In a real implementation, you would:
1. Run the colorful_nmap.py script against a target with known deprecated versions
2. Take a screenshot of the terminal showing the colorized output
3. Save it as screenshot.png in this directory
4. Replace this text file with that image
